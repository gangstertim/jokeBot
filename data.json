Confused, the first farmer quickly turns around and drives off.\nLater that night he tells his wife what he saw and says, \"I just don't know.

I mean, I know he's not the brightest bulb in the box but this is just strange.\"\nHis wife says, \"Well maybe its not as serious as you think. Why don't you just ask him about it over a few drinks?\"\nSo the farmer calls his friend and after a few beers he says \"Listen man. The other day I came by your house and saw you having sex with your tractor and just wanted to find out whats going on.\"\nThe second farmer hangs his head and says, \"Well, I didn't want to tell you but me and the old lady ain't doing so hot. We fight all the time and we never have sex. So she thought it be a good idea to see one of those fancy couple's counselors.
